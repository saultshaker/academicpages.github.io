Hello!

I'm Saul Schaffer - a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow at Carngie Mellon University in the Biohybrid and Organic Robotics Group ([BORG](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/faculty/borg/index.html)). My research is at the intersection of bioengineering and robotics. My Ph.D. focuses on developing a toolkit for engineering living, biohybrid robots actuated by biological muscle tissue. I am scheduled to defend my thesis in August 2024. 

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I earned a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Maryland at College Park. 

Beyond research, I am also a avid artist. I love to design my work using 3D modeling softwares like Meshmixer and SolidWorks. I often 3D print my work in plastic. I especially love working in glass as a medium. Check out my art <a href="portfolio">here</a>.

Additionally, I'm passionate about STEM outreach.
