Hello!

I'm Saul Schaffer -- a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow at Carngie Mellon University in the Biohybrid and Organic Robotics Group ([BORG](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/faculty/borg/index.html))




I'm Pam Cai â€“ a 2024 Arnold O. Beckman Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Tirrell Lab](https://pme.uchicago.edu/group/tirrell-lab) at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, where my focus is on synthesizing sustainable polymer materials by leveraging polyelectrolyte complexation. I successfully defended my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering at Stanford University in May 2023. During my Ph.D., I worked with [Professor Andrew Spakowitz](https://web.stanford.edu/~ajspakow/) and [Professor Sarah Heilshorn](https://web.stanford.edu/group/heilshorn/), focusing on using polymer physics models to gain fundamental insight into biomaterial development and biological fluid physics. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I completed a B.S. in Chemical Engineering at MIT.  

Besides <a href="research">research</a>, I am also very dedicated to STEM outreach and have been a part of many mentoring organizations with missions to help women and underrepresented minorities to gain access to resources they need to succeed, including [Minds Matter](https://mindsmatternyc.org) in New York City and [Future Advancers for Science and Technology (FAST)](https://fast.stanford.edu) at Stanford. I am especially passionate about introducing more students to the field of chemical engineering, which I think gives a great skillset to tackle most modern engineering challenges.
